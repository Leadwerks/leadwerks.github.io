<h1>Models</h1>

<table>
<td>
Models are high-detail objects that can be placed throughout the scene.
Model vertices are static, and cannot be moved, but the model matrix can be rotated, positioned, and scaled to fit the model into different spaces.

<p>Models are characterized by the following:
<li>Models are complex polygonal objects.
<li>Models are instanced, meaning that only one copy of the vertex data is stored in memory.
<li>Models are lit with vertex lighting, and can cast and receive shadows.
<li>Models are rendered very fast per triangle.
