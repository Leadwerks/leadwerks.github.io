<h1>Solids Overview</h1>

<table>
<td>
Solids are a type of geometry that follow special rules.
Solids can be used to perform mathematical calculations that do not work with arbitrary polygons.
These include binary space partitioning (BSP), constructive solid geometry operations (CSG), fast collision, and visibility occlusion.

<p>Solids are characterized by the following:
<li>Solids are simple geometric primitives, like a box or cylinder.
<li>Unlike meshes, solids each contain unique vertex and polygon data.
<li>Solids are lightmapped, and can cast and receive shadows.

<p>Solids are used for the following:
<li>Form the basic shape of your scene with walls and floors.
<li>Create invisible trigger fields the player walks into.
<li>Create portal zones and antiportals for portal-based engines.

<p>Solid geometry must follow the following rules:
<li>All faces must be coplanar.  This means that all the vertices of a face lie along the same plane.

<br><font size=1>Vertices have been moved to make the selected face non-coplanar.</font>
</center>

<p><li>Solids must be convex, not concave.  This means that all the faces must point out, away from each other.
