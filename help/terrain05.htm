<h1>Lighting Terrain</h1>

Terrains are lit with lightmaps.  Terrains cast shadows on and receive shadows from brushes and meshes.  Terrains are also self-shadowing.  A <i>sunlight</i> entity can be used to effectively simulate daylight on a terrain.  <i>Point</i> and <i>spotlights</i> can be used on terrain as well.
