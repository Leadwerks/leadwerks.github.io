<h1>Lighting Solids</h1>

Solids are lit with lightmaps.  They will cast and receive shadows.

<p><h2>Luxel Size</h2>
To adjust a solid's lightmap resolution, first press the <i>select subobject</i> <img src="select_subobject.jpg"> toolbar button to switch to <i>select subobject mode</i>.  Select the face(s) you wish to alter.  Decrease the luxel (lightmap pixel) size for higher-resolution shadows.  Increase the luxel size for lower resolution lighting.  Use small luxel sizes on surfaces that you want to receive more detailed shadows.  Use large luxel sizes on surfaces that the viewer is unlikely to see up close, like the top of a roof, or on surfaces on which no shadows will be cast.

<p><h2>Lightmap Leaks</h2>
Sometimes, a low-resolution lightmap will display lightmap leaks, spots where the light "leaks" through a solid wall.

<p>Lightmap leaks can be minimized by using a higher resolution lightmap.

<p><i>Beveled joints</i> can also minimize lightmaps leaks.
This has the additional benefit of decreasing polycount, because the joint faces can be removed.
