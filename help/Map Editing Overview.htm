<h1>Map Editing Overview</h1>

3D World Studio maps are made up of basic building blocks called <i>solids</i>.  Although they are created as simple shapes, solids can be clipped, carved, sliced, and combined to make any possible shape you might need.  This style of modeling is called constructive solid geometry (CSG), and it allows many things that conventional triangle meshes do not.  Binary space partitioning (BSP), portal occlusion, lightmapping, and fast collision are all aided with CSG.  In fact, virtually every high-performance 3D engine uses CSG solids for basic map geometry.

<p>The first step to build a map is to flesh out the simple structure with solids.  This stage allows you to plan out the shape and purpose of the map, and the "flow" of the design.  A figure-8 deathmatch map will have quite a different flow than a single player map.  Think about what you are going to use this map for, and draw out a rough sketch on paper.  Below, a single room has been built, with all hidden faces removed:

<p>The map doesn't look like much at this stage, but adding in models will increase detail and make the map more interesting.  Models are drawn much faster than solids, so you can use quite a few fairly high-poly models without fear.  When designing a new map, you should make a list of all models you will need.  The map designer can work on the solid geometry while waiting for the model artist to complete all necessary models.

<p>Now that the scene visuals are done, we add entities.  Entities store information like a position for the player to start, a light source, or a sound source.  Below, a row of spotlights has been added down the center.

<p>Lights are calculated and the map is ready to run in your 3D engine.

<p>You can export the map to an external file format, or for best results, you can make your 3D engine load the <a href="3dw_file_format_5-14-6.htm">.3dw (3D world) file format</a> directly.  

<p>You might wish to add many other types of entities to the map.  3D World Studio is a map editor, not a 3D engine.  It is up to your 3D engine to load the entities and decide what they should be used for.  You can add your own entity classes and adjust properties any way you like.
