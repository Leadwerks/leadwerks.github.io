<h1>Prefabs Overview</h1>

Prefabs are pre-made map sections that can be loaded and created like objects.  Prefabs can contain all the elements of 3D World Studio maps.

<p>To create a new prefab, select the <i>File\Save As...</i> menu item and select a .pfb (prefab) file to save in a subfolder in the prefabs path.  Restart the program and your prefab will be available to create as a new object.  For example, if you save the file "C:\Program Files\3D World Studio\prefabs\buildings\house01.pfb" the prefab "house01" will be available in the "buildings" object category.
