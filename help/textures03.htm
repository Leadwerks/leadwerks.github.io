<h1>Adding New Textures</h1>
You can add new textures to the <i>texture path</i> directory.
By default, this is set to root 3D World Studio directory.
The next time you start the program, the textures will be available to choose from.

<p>You can also set the <i>texture path</i> directory to the location where your project's textures are stored.
Select the <i>Tools>Options</i> menu item, and change the <i>texture path</i> to your project's texture directory.
Textures will then be loaded directly from your project's texture directory.
