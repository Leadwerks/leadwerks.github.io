<h1>Workflow</h1>

<li><i>Texture assets</i> are created in a paint program like Adobe Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro.
<li><i>Model assets</i> are created in a modeling program like 3ds max or Maya.
<li>3D World Studio loads texture and model assets, and builds a map.
<li>The map is either exported, or the 3D engine loads the .3dw (3D World) file directly.

<p><h2>Texture Assets</h2>
Textures can be stored in .bmp, .jpg, .pcx, .png, .tga, .dds, or .vtf formats.  To add a new texture to the editor, place the file in any subdirectory in the texture path.  Restart 3D World Studio, and your texture will be available.

<p>The default texture path is "C:\Program Files\3D World Studio\Materials\" so if you save a file "C:\Program Files\3D World Studio\Materials\walls\wall01.bmp", the texture "wall01" will be available in the "walls" texture category.

<p>You can also change the texture path so that 3D World Studio loads textures from your project's texture directory.  For example, you might change the texture path to "C:\My Projects\My Simulation\Textures\".  This is simpler and more reliable than storing textures in two different locations.

<p><h2>Model Assets</h2>
Models can be stored in .x, .md3, .gls, or .smf formats.  To add a new model to the editor, place the file in any subdirectory in the texture path.  Restart 3D World Studio, and your model will be available.

<p>The default model path is "C:\Program Files\3D World Studio\Models\" so if you save a file "C:\Program Files\3D World Studio\Models\vehicles\car01.x", the model  "car01" will be available in the "vehicles" model category.

<p>You can also change the model path so that 3D World Studio loads models from your project's model directory.  For example, you might change the model path to "C:\My Projects\My Simulation\Models\".  This is simpler and more reliable than storing models in two different locations.

<p>The .smf model file format is preferred because it is a fast-loading binary format.  ConvertModels is a converter utility included to convert .3ds and .x models to the .smf format.  The utility will open a directory request dialog, scan the selected directory for .x and .3ds models, and convert them to .smf files.  The program executable "ConvertModels.exe" must be in the same directory as 3D World Studio to work correctly.

<p><h2>Loading Maps</h2>
3D World Studio can export maps to the .map, .x, .b3d, .dbo, and .wmp formats.  However, all of these formats lose information in the export (lighting, entities, etc.).  To get the most out of 3D World Studio, it is recommended that you load the <a href="3dw_file_format_5-14-6.htm">.3dw (3D World) file format</a> directly.

<p>You can use the <a href="runmap.htm">run map dialog</a> to save a copy of the map and launch it in your own viewer.  This is the recommended setup, and will make development much easier.
