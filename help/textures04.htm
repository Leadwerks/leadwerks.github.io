<h1>Transparent Textures</h1>
Transparent and masked textures may be created, using a 32-bit image with an alpha channel.
Alpha channels are supported in the .tga, .png, and .dds formats.
The following rules are applied when loading 32-bit textures:
<li>If all pixel alpha values are 255, the texture is solid.
<li>If all pixel alpha values are either 0 or 255, the texture is masked.
<li>If any pixel alpha values are in the range of 1-254, the texture is transparent.

<p>Transparent textures will affect lights, and can be used to create dramatic effects.
Objects painted with a transparent texture will not be lit.
This is because lightmaps would darken areas that are supposed to be transparent.
