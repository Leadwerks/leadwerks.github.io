<p><h2>Undo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrl+Z</h2>
This will allow you to undo the last change you made to the loaded map. 

<p><h2>Cut&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrl+X</h2>
Deletes the currently selected objects from the map, and stores a copy of them in memory to be pasted later.

<p><h2>Copy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrl+C</h2>
Copies the currently selected objects into memory without removing the original.

<p><h2>Paste&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrl+V</h2>
Pastes a copy of any cut or copied objects into the current map.  Pasted objects will appear in the exact same position as the originals, but will be selected so that you can move them wherever you like.

<p><h2>Delete&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Del</h2>
This will delete the currently selected objects from the map, without copying them to memory.  When in <i>subobject selection mode</i>, this command will hide any selected solid faces.  Hidden faces can still be selected.

<p><h2>Select All</h2>
This will select all visible objects in the map.

<p><h2>Select None</h2>
This will deselect all objects in the map.

<p><h2>Invert Selection</h2>
This will invert the selection state of all visible objects in the map.  If an object was selected, this operation will deselect it.  If an object wasn't selected, this operation will select it.

<p><h2>Select Object&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z</h2>
This will switch the editor to <i>select object mode</i>, allowing you to select whole objects, or groups of objects.  This is the default selection mode when the program starts.

<p><h2>Select Subobject&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X</h2>
This will switch the editor to <i>select suboject mode</i>, allowing you to select solid faces and model subobjects.  <i>Select suboject mode</i> is used mostly for applying and adjusting textures.

<p><h2>Select Vertex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C</h2>
This will switch the editor to <i>select vertex mode</i>, allowing you to select solid vertices and move them.  Model vertices cannot be moved.

<p><h2>Properties...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shift+Enter</h2>
This will open the <a href="properties.htm">properties dialog</a>, allowing you to edit properties for the selected object(s).
